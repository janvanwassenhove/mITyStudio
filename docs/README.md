## 🔧 Technical Overview

### AI Multi-Agent System
mITyStudio employs a sophisticated multi-agent workflow using LangGraph to coordinate different aspects of music composition:

1. **Composer Agent** - Creates chord progressions and song structure
2. **Arrangement Agent** - Determines instrumentation and track layout
3. **Lyrics Agent** - Generates contextual lyrics with syllable mapping
4. **Vocal Agent** - Handles vocal synthesis and harmony generation
5. **Effects Agent** - Applies audio processing and spatial positioning
6. **Finalization Agent** - Optimizes mix balance and final output

### Extended Vocal Capabilities
The system supports advanced vocal synthesis features:
- **Syllable-to-Note Mapping** - Precise control over lyrical timing
- **IPA Phoneme Support** - International Phonetic Alphabet for accurate pronunciation
- **Melisma Detection** - Automatic identification of extended vocal runs
- **Multi-Voice Harmony** - Coordinated harmony generation with stereo positioning
- **Section-Aware Lyrics** - Contextual lyric generation based on song structure

### SoundFont Integration
Professional-quality instrument simulation using SoundFont 2.0 technology:
- **Dynamic Sampling** - Velocity-sensitive instrument response
- **Multiple Articulations** - Various playing techniques per instrument
- **Admin-Managed Library** - Expandable instrument collection
- **Real-Time Performance** - Low-latency playback for interactive composition
