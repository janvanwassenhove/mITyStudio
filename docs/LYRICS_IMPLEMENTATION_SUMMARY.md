- **Phonetic Notation**: Includes IPA phonemes for pronunciation guidance
- **Musical Timing**: Precise duration and melisma information
- **Multi-voice Support**: Handles complex vocal arrangements

## üéµ User Experience Flow

### Before (Confusing):
1. User requests lyrics from AI
2. AI shows raw JSON structure
3. Multiple confusing buttons: "Add Vocal Track", "Add to Lyrics Section", "Add Lyrics & Vocals"
4. User unsure which button to choose
5. Manual process to get lyrics into song structure

### After (Streamlined):
1. User requests lyrics from AI
2. AI shows **beautifully formatted lyrics** with proper styling
3. **Single "Apply to Song" button** with clear action
4. One click handles everything automatically
5. Lyrics appear in both Song tab and as vocal tracks

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Enhanced AI Prompt (Backend)
```python
# Now generates comprehensive lyrics with:
"syllables": [
  {
    "t": "Shine",
    "noteIdx": [0, 1], 
    "dur": 0.8,
    "melisma": true
  }
],
"phonemes": [" É", "a…™", "n"]
```

### Smart Detection (Frontend)
```typescript
const isLyricsJSON = (jsonData: any): boolean => {
  return (
    jsonData.instrument === 'vocals' || 
    jsonData.type === 'lyrics' || 
    jsonData.voices || 
    (jsonData.clips && jsonData.clips.some((c: any) => c.voices))
  )
}
```

### Unified Action Handler
```typescript
const applyLyricsToSong = (encodedJSON: string) => {
  // 1. Extract lyrics text for Song tab
  // 2. Create/find vocals track  
  // 3. Add clips with musical data
  // 4. Update song structure
  // 5. Provide user feedback
}
```

## üé® Visual Improvements

### Lyrics Display Styling
- **Header**: Primary color background with microphone icon
- **Content**: Gradient background with clean typography
- **Sections**: Clear separation between multiple sections
- **Lines**: Individual lyric lines with left border accent
- **Voices**: Labeled voice parts for multi-voice arrangements

### Enhanced Button Styling
- **Primary Action**: Larger, more prominent "Apply to Song" button
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth animations and color transitions
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear state changes and loading indicators

## üìù Example Lyrics Display

When AI generates lyrics, users now see:

```
üé§ Generated Lyrics

Voice 1 (soprano01)
Walking down this lonely street tonight

Voice 2 (alto01) 
Searching for a guiding light

[Apply to Song] ‚Üê Single, clear action
```

Instead of:
```
JSON Structure ‚Ä∫
{
  "instrument": "vocals",
  "voices": [
    {
      "voice_id": "soprano01",
      "lyrics": [
        {
          "text": "Walking",
          "notes": ["C4"],
          // ... complex JSON structure
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

[Add Vocal Track] [Add to Lyrics Section] [Add Lyrics & Vocals] ‚Üê Confusing!
```
